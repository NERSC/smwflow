# NERSC smwflow

The smwflow software package is a set of python scripts that will help manage
Cray XC systems using SMW 8.0 by localizing all configurations into a set of
git repositories.  Moreover multiple systems can be imported into the git
repositories and fully merged to enable co-management of test and production
systems (or multiple test/production system environments).

NOTE:  this software is still in development and is not fully functional yet.
